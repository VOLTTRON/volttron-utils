    # Sometimes youâ€™ll want to use packages that are properly arranged with
    # setuptools, but are not published to PyPI. In those cases, you can specify
    # a list of one or more dependency_links URLs where the package can
    # be downloaded, along with some additional hints, and setuptools
    # will find and install the package correctly.

    # To provide executable scripts, use entry points in preference to the
    # "scripts" keyword. Entry points provide cross-platform support and allow
    # `pip` to create the appropriate form of executable for the target
    # platform.
    #
    # For example, the following would provide a command called `sample` which
    # executes the function `main` from this package when invoked:
    # entry_points={"console_scripts": ["sample=sample:main"]},  # Optional

    # issues, where the source is hosted, where to say thanks to the package
    # maintainers, and where to support the project financially. The key is
    # what's used to render the link text on PyPI.
